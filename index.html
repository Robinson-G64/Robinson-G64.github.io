                    <p>I am a full-stack web developer based in central London. I am at the start of my developer career having been a primary school teacher for the past few years.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I have loved using and working with technology since my family were gifted out first computer from my grandmother. I dabbled a little in HTML, CSS, and C as a teenager but I didn't realise my love for programming until I began teaching myself Python and Javascript aloongside teaching.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Learning to code has been a fun challenge, something I've looked forward to doing at the end of the day after work!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When I'm not programming you can find me exploring, hiking, working out, or attempting to learn a new language!</p>
